Basics
------

.. code:: python

    from gurunudi import AI,api

    api.key='<YOUR_API_KEY>' #Set your Gurunudi API Key
    AI("sample text")

API key needs to be setup at the beginning only once in an application. Visit `https://gurulaghu.com <https://gurulaghu.com>` to get an API key.

AI is a class with simple yet intelligent attributes. Create an AI object by passing your text as the argument. AI takes a second optional argument as the language code which if not present, defaults to English (except for language detection call). The language code is a 3-letter `ISO 639-3 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes>`_. For language codes and features currently supported by each language, see `supported languages <https://gurulaghu.com/languages/>`_.

Chatbot
-------

.. code:: python

    response = AI("how are you?").chat #returns a string ex: "I am fine"
    response = AI("where is Badami").chat #returns a string ex: "in Karnataka, India"
    response = AI("do you eat cakes?").chat #returns a string ex: "softwares do not eat"
    response = AI("solve 3x-12=0").chat #returns a string ex: "4"

.. code:: python

    intent = AI("hi").intent
    #returns "[{"intent":"greeting"}]"

    intent = AI("Delhi is in India").language 
    #returns [{"intent":"statement","theme":"Delhi","attribute":"location","value",:"India","tense":"present"}]

    intent = AI("John went to Chicago").language 
    #returns [{"intent":"statement","agent":"John","action":"go","destination",:"Chicago","tense":"past"}]

    intent = AI("book a flight to mumbai").language
    #returns [{"intent":"command","action":"book","theme":"flight","destination":"Mumbai","tense":"present"}]

    intent = AI("where is berlin?").intent
    #returns [{"intent":"query","theme":"Berlin","query_type":"attribute_value","attribute":"location","tense":"present"}]


Language Detection

    #now coreferenced_text = "Einstein was a brillian scientist. Einstein was born in Germany."

    coreferenced_text = AI("The women stopped taking pills because they were pregnant.").coreferenced_text
    #now coreferenced_text = "The women stopped taking pills because the women were pregnant"


Spell Check
-----------

.. code:: python

    corrected_text = AI("whois that") #fixes any spelling errors and returns the corrected text
    #now corrected_text = "who is that"

    sentences = AI("Mr. India was a great movie. It was directed by Shekhar Kapur.").sentences
    #now sentences = ["Mr. India was a great movie.", "It was directed by Shekhar Kapur."]


Syntax Analysis (Part-of-speech tagging)
----------------------------------------

    syntax = AI("Indian scientists discover new planet").syntax
    #now syntax =  [{'pos': 'ADJ', 'lemma': 'indian', 'text': 'Indian', 'index': 1}, {'pos': 'NOUN', 'lemma': 'scientist', 'text': 'scientists', 'index': 2}, {'pos': 'VERB', 'lemma': 'discover', 'text': 'discover', 'index': 3}, {'pos': 'ADJ', 'lemma': 'new', 'text': 'new', 'index': 4}, {'pos': 'NOUN', 'lemma': 'planet', 'text': 'planet', 'index': 5}]


Dependency Parse Tree
---------------------

.. code:: python

    dependency = AI("Indian scientists discover new planet").dependency
    #now dependency =  [{'text': 'Indian scientists discover new planet', 'dependencies': [{'dependency': 'amod', 'head': 2, 'text': 'Indian', 'index': 1}, {'dependency': 'nsubj', 'head': 3, 'text': 'scientists', 'index': 2}, {'dependency': 'ROOT', 'head': 3, 'text': 'discover', 'index': 3}, {'dependency': 'amod', 'head': 5, 'text': 'new', 'index': 4}, {'dependency': 'dobj', 'head': 3, 'text': 'planet', 'index': 5}]

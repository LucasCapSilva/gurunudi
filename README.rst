Basics
------

.. code:: python

    from gurunudi import AI,api

    api.key='<YOUR_API_KEY>' #Set your Gurunudi API Key
    ai=AI("sample text")

API key needs to be setup at the beginning only once in an application. Visit `https://gurulaghu.com <https://gurulaghu.com>` to get an API key.

AI is a class with simple yet intelligent attributes. Create an AI object by passing your text as the argument. AI takes a second optional argument as the language code which if not present, defaults to English (except for language detection call). The language code is a 3-letter `ISO 639-3 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes>`_. For language codes and features currently supported by each language, see `supported languages <https://gurulaghu.com/languages/>`_.

.. code:: python

    from gurunudi import lang
    ai=AI("‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤ü‡≤ï ‡≤ï‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤°",lang.KANNADA) #Specify the language if non-English text

Chatbot
-------

.. code:: python

    response = AI("how are you?").chat #returns a string ex: "I am fine"
    response = AI("where is Badami").chat #returns a string ex: "in Karnataka, India"
    response = AI("do you eat cakes?").chat #returns a string ex: "software do not eat"
    response = AI("solve 3x-12=0").chat #returns a string ex: "4"


Co-reference Resolution
-----------------------

.. code:: python

    coreferenced_text = AI("Einstein was a brillian scientist. He was born in Germany.").coreferenced_text
    #now coreferenced_text = "Einstein was a brillian scientist. Einstein was born in Germany."

    coreferenced_text = AI("The women stopped taking pills because they were pregnant.").coreferenced_text
    #now coreferenced_text = "The women stopped taking pills because the women were pregnant"


Definition
----------

.. code:: python

    definition = AI("sun").definition 
    #now definition = "the star that is the source of light and heat for the planets in the solar system"


Fix Case (True Case)
--------------------

.. code:: python

    case_fixed_text = AI("delhi is the capital of iNdia").fix_case
    #now case_fixed_text = "Delhi is the capital of India"


Intent Extraction
-----------------

.. code:: python

    intent = AI("hi").intent
    #returns "[{"intent":"greeting"}]"

    intent = AI("Delhi is in India").language 
    #returns [{"intent":"statement","theme":"Delhi","attribute":"location","value",:"India","tense":"present"}]

    intent = AI("John went to Chicago").language 
    #returns [{"intent":"statement","agent":"John","action":"go","destination",:"Chicago","tense":"past"}]

    intent = AI("book a flight to mumbai").language
    #returns [{"intent":"command","action":"book","theme":"flight","destination":"Mumbai","tense":"present"}]

    intent = AI("where is berlin?").intent
    #returns [{"intent":"query","theme":"Berlin","query_type":"attribute_value","attribute":"location","tense":"present"}]


Keyword Extraction
------------------

.. code:: python

    keywords = AI("Delhi is in India").keywords
    #now keywords = ['India', 'Delhi']


Language Detection
------------------

.. code:: python

    language = AI("lorem ipsum").language
    #now language = "Latin"

    language = AI("‡≤®‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤® ‡≤π‡≥Ü‡≤∏‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤ó‡≥Å‡≤∞‡≥Å").language
    #now language = "Kannada"


Named Entities Extraction
-------------------------

.. code:: python

    named_entities = AI("India is in Asia").named_entities #returns a list of named entities, their labels and position in the text
    #now named_entities = [{"label": "GPE", "end": 5, "start": 0, "name": "India"}, {"label": "LOC", "end": 16, "start": 12, "name": "Asia"}]


Sentence Extraction
-------------------

.. code:: python

    sentences = AI("Mr. India was a great movie. It was directed by Shekhar Kapur.").sentences
    #now sentences = ["Mr. India was a great movie.", "It was directed by Shekhar Kapur."]


Sentiment Analysis
------------------

.. code:: python

    sentiment = AI("I really did not like that movie").sentiment

    sentiment = AI("she is very beautiful").sentiment #returns "positive"
    #now sentiment = "positive"

    sentiment = AI("The ambience was good, but the food was bad").sentiment #returns "mixed"
    #now sentiment = "mixed"

    sentiment = AI("roses are red, violets are blue").sentiment #returns "neutral"
    #now sentiment = "neutral"


Spell Check
-----------

.. code:: python

    corrected_text = AI("whois cming tmorrow").spell_checked_text
    #now corrected_text = "who is coming tomorrow"


Summary Generation
------------------

.. code:: python

    summary = AI("<SOME_LONG_TEXT>").summary
    #now summary = <summary_of_the_long_text>


Syntax Analysis
---------------

.. code:: python

    syntax = AI("Moon creates waves").syntax
    #now syntax = [{'pos': 'PROPN', 'lemma': 'moon', 'text': 'Moon'}, {'pos': 'VERB', 'lemma': 'create', 'text': 'creates'}, {'pos': 'NOUN', 'lemma': 'wave', 'text': 'waves'}]


Syntax Dependency Parse Tree
----------------------------

.. code:: python

    syntax_tree = AI("Moon creates waves").syntax_tree
    #now syntax_tree = [{'head': 1, 'dep': 'nsubj', 'text': 'Moon'}, {'head': 1, 'dep': 'ROOT', 'text': 'creates'}, {'head': 1, 'dep': 'dobj', 'text': 'waves'}]


Title Generation
----------------

.. code:: python

    from gurunudi import lang

    title = AI("<SOME_LONG_TEXT>").title
    #now title = "<TITLE_SUGGESTED_BY_GURUNUDI_AI>"


Topic Modeling
--------------

.. code:: python

    topics = AI("Can Trump and Kim end the Korean War?").topics
    #now topics = ["Politics"]

    topics = AI("Planning To Buy A House? There Is Good News For You").topics
    #now topics = ["Business"]


Translation
-----------

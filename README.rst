üìñ Documentation
================

Basics
-----

.. code:: python

    from gurunudi import ai

    ai('sample text') #language is assumed to be English
    ai('Beispieltext','deu') #language of text is set to German

All calls are made by passing the text to ai as an argument. ai takes a second optional argument as the language code which defaults to english. The language code can be either a 2-letter `ISO 639-1 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_ or a 3-letter `ISO 639-3 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes>`_. For language codes and features currently supported by each language, see `supported languages <https://gurulaghu.com/languages/>`_.

All the AI functionalities of Gurunudi are available as properties of the ai object. (See below)

Chatbot
-------

.. code:: python

    response = ai('how are you?').chat #returns a string ex: "I am fine"
    response = ai('where is Badami').chat #returns a string ex: "in Karnataka, India"
    response = ai('do you eat cakes?').chat #returns a string ex: "softwares do not eat"
    response = ai('solve 3x-12=0').chat #returns a string ex: "4"

Language Detection
------------------

.. code:: python

    language_name = ai('lorem ipsum').language #returns "Latin"
    language_name = ai('‡≤®‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤® ‡≤π‡≥Ü‡≤∏‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤ó‡≥Å‡≤∞‡≥Å').language #returns "Kannada"

Sentiment Analysis
------------------

.. code:: python

    sentiment = ai('I really did not like that movie').sentiment #returns "positive"
    sentiment = ai('she is very beautiful').sentiment #returns "negative"
    sentiment = ai('The ambience was good, but the food was bad').sentiment #returns "mixed"
    sentiment = ai('roses are red, violets are blue').sentiment #returns "neutral"

Co-reference Resolution
-----------------------

.. code:: python

    corefed_text = ai('Einstein was a brillian scientist. He was born in Germany.').coref_resolved_text
    #now corefed_text = 'Einstein was a brillian scientist. Einstein was born in Germany.'

    corefed_text = ai('The women stopped taking pills because they were pregnant.').coref_resolved_text
    #now corefed_text = 'The women stopped taking pills because the women were pregnant'

Named Entities
--------------

.. code:: python

    named_entities = ai('India is in Asia').named_entities #returns a list of named entities, their labels and position in the text
    #now named_entities = [{'label': 'GPE', 'end': 5, 'start': 0, 'name': 'India'}, {'label': 'LOC', 'end': 16, 'start': 12, 'name': 'Asia'}]

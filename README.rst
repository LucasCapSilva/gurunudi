üìñ Documentation
================

Basics
-----

All calls are made by passing the text to ai as an argument. ai takes a second optional argument as the language code which defaults to english. The language code can be either a 2-letter `ISO 639-1 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_ or a 3-letter `ISO 639-3 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes>`_. For language codes and features currently supported by each language, see `supported languages <https://gurulaghu.com/languages/>`_

.. code:: python

    from gurunudi import ai

    ai('sample text') #text language defaults to English
    ai('Beispieltext','deu') #now language of text is set to German

All the AI functionalities of Gurunudi are available as properties of the ai object. (See below)

Chatbot
-------

.. code:: python

    response = ai('how are you?').chat #returns a string ex: "I am fine"
    response = ai('where is Badami').chat #returns a string ex: "in Karnataka, India"
    response = ai('do you eat cakes?').chat #returns a string ex: "softwares do not eat"
    response = ai('solve 3x-12=0').chat #returns a string ex: "4"

Language Detection
------------------

.. code:: python

    language_name = ai('lorem ipsum').language #returns "Latin"
    language_name = ai('‡≤®‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤® ‡≤π‡≥Ü‡≤∏‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤ó‡≥Å‡≤∞‡≥Å').language #returns "Kannada"

#AI is a class with simple yet intelligent attributes. Create an AI object by passing your document text as the argument to the constructor.
ai = AI("Larry Page was doing his Phd at Stanford University in 1996.")

#The AI attribute "named_entities" returns a list of named entities found in the text
#Each entry in the list is a dictionary containing a named entity's text, its label and its position in the original text
print(ai.named_entities)

#If there was any error during the attribute call, then ai.latest_error will contain the error string, else it will be None
#if ai.named_entities returns None i.e. if named entities extraction API fails, then check this value for the corresponding error message
assert(ai.latest_error==None)

#By default the text is assumed to be in English language. If the text is in a different language, you can pass the corresponding language code. See example below for German text.

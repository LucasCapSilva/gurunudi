#AI is a class with simple yet intelligent attributes. Create an AI object by passing your document text as the argument to the constructor.
ai = AI("i went to jaPan")

#The AI attribute "fix_case" returns a case fixed version of given text
print(ai.fix_case == "I went to Japan")

#If there was any error during the attribute call, then ai.latest_error will contain the error string, else it will be None
#if ai.fix_case returns None i.e. if fix case API fails, then check this value for the corresponding error message
assert(ai.latest_error==None)

#By default the text is assumed to be in English language. If the text is in a different language, you can pass the corresponding language code. See example below for German text.
ai = AI("Emmanuel Macron est le pr√©sident de la France.",gurunudi.FRENCH)
